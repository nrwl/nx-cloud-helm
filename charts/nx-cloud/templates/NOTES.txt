BREAKING CHANGE: As of Helm chart version 0.15.13 we have stopped using helm based VCS Integration configs. If you have defined
any of the "github.pr" or "gitlab.mr" values in your config.yaml, please remove them and setup your VCS integration via your
workspace "Settings" page.

See https://nx.dev/ci/reference/release-notes for an expanded version of this note.
